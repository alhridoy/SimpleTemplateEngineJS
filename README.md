# SimpleTemplateEngineJS

This template engine can:

Replace variables.
Handle if-conditions.
Loop through arrays.
Convert template comments to HTML comments.
Include content from other templates.
The engine uses regular expressions extensively to find and replace template directives with the desired output. The design is fairly simple, making it easy to extend or adjust to specific needs.
